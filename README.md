# Polynomial-Calculator
This project is an assignment of the Senior Programming Projects I course.

There are two branches. One branch uses flex and bison to do lexical analysis and syntax analysis, 
and supports more natural formula input. The other branch uses a simple parser implemented through regular expressions.

# Features
- Polynomial calculation (Shunting Yard Algorithm).
- Fast polynomial multiplication (FFT).
- Polynomial long division.
- Graphical interface (Qt).
- Draw function image (QtChart).
- Save and read the results and intermediate variables to file.
